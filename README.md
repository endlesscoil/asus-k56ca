This repository contains a few quality-of-life improvements for my Asus K56CA.

- **brightness.py**: Adjusts screen brightness.  If someone finds a decent combination of ACPI params that actually make the function buttons work, let me know.
- **fixtouchpad.sh**: This configures synaptics to minimize palm interference while avoiding the bugginess of palm detection.  Also provides a way to reload everything should the cursor inevitably lock up, usually after resuming from a sleep.
